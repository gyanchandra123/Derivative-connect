 Simple Interest:-
----------------------
si = initial investment *(1+ (interestRate *no. of periods))


compound Interest:
------------------
1. interest is earn both from both the initial investment + prevoius period interest.
Example :-   
		interest calculation  :
	----------------------------------------
		1. 10% interest calculated on the initial investment 
		2. 10% interest calculated on the previous interest amount.

*** from this we can conclude that the compound interest is the kind of interest that we would like to recieve not pay.


2. It is caLculated as Future value	

 
Annuity
----------------

1. it is a series of equal payment that we either recieved or paid.
2.Example :-   monthly rent payment

3. For a series of payment to be annuity?
Ans : condition is : the payment should be of equal , period.

4. types :
--------------------
	a. annuity due : payment made at the starting of the month.(room rent pay at the date 1 of every month)
	b. ordinary annuity : payment or recieved at the ending of the month.

present Value : 
Today's value of money ,from some points in the future.



 

 

example :-
-----------
Here $100 = ordinary anuity
1. suppose we wish to recieved $100 in a year with a discount rate of 10% for 3 years , what would be the present value? 
 
  
 
IntraYearCompunding Interest:  
 
1. means when the inerest is compounded more than once a year like semi-annually.  .
2.Here , we need to calculate "the semi-anually/.... compounding period rate :(annual rate/no. of periods yearly)"
 [which is differen from the annual compounding rate]   . 

3. total Number of periods = total years* periods per year.
Example : we need to calculate the future value [with intra year compoundingS]
  

Note : - we need the below 2 things :
a.	Compounding period rate .
b.	Total number of periods.
 
         
 
Example : to earn $1000 every month for the next  6months, annual interest rate = 10%,
 
Example :- 
 
 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Derivative :
--------------------
1. what is derivative ?
Ans : contract develop between 2 entities  based on some underlying assets like : "Turkey"

	contract : pay $300, now then confirmation of delvering 20 turkey is possible in the next 3 months.


2. TYpes of derivatve :
Ans :

	a. future or forward :[the shop will deliver 20 turkey at the end of 3 month]
		1. here he paid $300 in advance and suppose to recieved 20 turkey at the end of 3 month   
		2. payment done earlier , and expected to get the products by the end of period.

	b.option : 
		1. here there are chances that the previous farm may fail by the end of 3 months.
		2. So, he paid another $50 now , and signed a contract to get 20 turkeys at $15 a turkey by the end of 3 month.
		3. here he is secured , Why?
		Ans : he didn't make the complete payment, just by paying some advance money , he is safe to execise the contract.

	c. swap :
		0. this works on foating interest rate.
		1. converting/swaping  float interest rate to fixed interest rate?
	Ans :-   a. Want to recieved $1000 recieved every year
		 b. but the compounding interest rate varies every year .
		 c. but the bank ask to pay a present value at a fixed interest rate of 5% .
		 d. if there is rise or fall of money value due to rate% rise or fall , bank will atke care.

		** HERE THE underlying contract is the swaping of floating interest rate to fixed

note :
-----------------
1. we can trade the contract in derivative in 2 ways:
	a. exchange (exchange in Japan)
	b. OTC : over the counter(like the trade between me and the chicken farm)

Example : the contract of $300  can be sold/trade to someone in 2 ways
		a. by lossing : after 2 months , the price of the turkey becomes cheaper. So he will sell the contract to someone by
				lossing $100 

		b. by gaining : avaibility of turkey is very rare after 2 months , so he can sell the contract to another at $400
			and tell him that he can sell the turkey at $500 at market.


Q. what is the levarage ?
Ans :- the borrow money to sign a contract .

*** with refernce to exchange derivative : there is a risk to me . why?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ans :- 
	a. if i made the contract by leverage 
	b. and if the price of the contract goes down , I will be lossing.
 

3. TRADE
----------------
1. each and every financial contract is called a trade.


counter-party risk:-
------------------------

"the shop keeper run away after taking the contract money".


*** In trading there are 3 office -
-----------------------------------------------
1. front office desk
2. middle office desk
3. back office desk.


Q. what is pnemonics?

Q.book?

 
Long will benefit : if the market interest rate is higher Like 7% then our borrow rate of 6%
